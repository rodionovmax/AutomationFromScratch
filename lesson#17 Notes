1. Docker
a. Install Docker /** https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium */ read everything here
b. run some script to install (find in documentation how to install on Mac)
c. In BaseUI add cases to launch Docker
d. Change testNG.xml to run tests via Docker
e. Created docker-compose.yml

2. Page factories
a. In MainPage created @FindBy // That's not the best solution because Page Factory works just in class where it was initialized
        and therefore it puts limits on using locators from Locators and strings from Data. Plus we can't use ExplicitWait
        because it's looking for webElement

3. Soft Assertions
a. Initialize SoftAssert in BaseUI
b. soft.AssertAll();
    The difference between hard assertions and soft assertions is that soft assertions allow to run test to the end and then
    print results w/o breaking test if assert fails

4. Split strings

5. iFrame

6. Record video in TestNG
a. in test type @Video(name = "video_name")
b. add dependency in pom.xml video-recorder-testng
c. in Test class before class declaration add @Listeners(VideoListener.class), like in Lesson17

7. Nested Loops
